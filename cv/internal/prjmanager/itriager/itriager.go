// Triage triages a component deciding what and when has to be done.

// Triage is called outside of transaction context.

// Triage must treat all given data as read-only. If it needs to modify
// component, it should use copy-on-write approach.
//
// Project Manager guarantees that for each CL of the given component:
//   - there is a PCL via Supporter interface,
//   - and for each such CL's dependency, either:
//   - dep is not yet loaded,
//   - OR dep must be itself a component's CL.
//
// May return special, possibly wrapped, ErrOutdatedPMState to signal that
// Triage function has detected outdated PMState.
